    <h1>Model Testing Results</h1>
    
<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:18px;"><b>Problem Statement:</b> Most radiologists leverage standard report templates when interpreting an imaging exam like a CAT scan. However, much time is spent in adjusting the template to actually reflect the findings from the imaging study. The tool here is being designed such that the radiologist would only need to provide relevant findings from the study and then leverage an LLM to intelligently incorporate those findings into a final report, including generating the summary of the report (referred to as Impression).</p>

    
<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:24px;">
  <b>Purpose:</b> This test evaluates the ability of various local LLM models (running via Ollama) to generate a radiology report from a user prompt, using a provided radiology report template as a base. The goal is to determine which models best follow instructions to keep the template unchanged except for lines that must be updated based on the user's findings. Only the relevant lines in the template should be changed, and the rest should remain as in the original template. The summary table below shows the Impression section for each model, allowing for quick comparison of clinical accuracy and template adherence.

Okay, let me process this carefully. The user wants an update to the radiology report based on their provided findings: gallstones, fat stranding around the pancreas, and possible diverticulitis.

Looking at the template structure, I need to preserve everything except modifying specific parts. For the Gallbladder finding, it currently says "Normal" but needs to reflect actual gallstones present. The current line is "<li><strong>Gallbladder:</strong> Normal. No evidence of stones.</li>". Since the user mentions gallstones were seen, I should change this to say there are multiple gallstones while keeping other elements unchanged.

Next, for Pancreas in the template it says "Normal. No surrounding edema." But now with fat stranding noted - this indicates inflammation or pathology. The proper term would be "inflammation" rather than just normal appearance.

Lastly regarding Pelvis, the template marks Appendix as normal but doesn't mention diverticulitis. I need to add a new list item about possible diverticulitis in the bowel section while keeping all other parts of the report intact.

  <h3>Procedure:</h3>
  <p>Helical CT Abdomen and Pelvis examination performed with axial sections after administration of non-ionic IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal 3 mm thick reformats also acquired. CT scan performed according to ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) dose protocol.</p>

  <h3>Comparison:</h3>
  <p>None.</p>

  <h3>Findings:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Liver:</strong> Normal appearance and size. No focal lesion.</li>
    <li><strong>Gallbladder:</strong> Normal in size, however multiple gallstones are noted within the lumen.</li>
    <li><strong>Spleen:</strong> Normal in size.</li>
    <li><strong>Pancreas:</strong> Focal fat stranding is present suggesting inflammation or pathology. No surrounding edema.</li>
    <li><strong>Adrenal glands:</strong> No nodules.</li>
    <li><strong>Kidneys:</strong> Symmetric bilateral renal enhancement is present. No hydronephrosis.</li>
    <li><strong>Peritoneum:</strong> There is no free air or abscess.</li>
    <li><strong>Bowel:</strong> No obstruction. Mucosa appears normal; however, diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon is suggested by localized wall thickening and possibly associated fat stranding in the pelvis (though not specifically mentioned here).</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Liver:</strong> Normal appearance and size. Focus on the presence of any gallstones.</li>
                <li><strong>Gallblad0der:</strong> Gallstones present which are concerning for cholelithiasis, follow up required to assess need for intervention or further management due to potential complications such as acute cholecystitis. Note presence of stones and size/shape that may guide treatment plan.</li>
                <li><strong>Spleen:</strong> Normal in size - no focal lesion noted, spleen appearance within normal limits for patient demographic (if applicable). No findings concerning splenic enlargement or punctuate haematoma suggestive of trauma.</li>
                <li><strong>Pancreas:</strong> Fat stranding around pancreas is seen, which may be indicative of acute inflammation. Possible diverticulitis within the context of surrounding fat stranding noted in relation to small bowel loops; differential includes not only possible mild-to-moderate uncomplicated diverticulitis but also consideration for more concerning conditions such as pancreatitis or mass effect, which should be assessed further if clinically indicated. Consider correlating with the patient's symptoms and history.</li>
                <li><strong>Adrenal glands:</strong> No nodules detected within normal limits of adrenal size/appearance for both glands as seen on imaging; no signs suggestive of pheochromocytoma or other pathologies such as metastasis.</li>
                <li><strong>Kidneys:</strong> Symmetric bilateral renal enhancement is present. No hydronephrosis detected, which rules out urinary tract obstruction and ureteropelvic junction stones at this time - maintain vigilance for any signs of nephrolithiasis or pyonephrosis on follow-up imaging.</li>
                <li><strong>Peritoneum:</strong> No free air is observed, which rules out perforation such as a perforated viscus; absence of ascites with blunt signs like haustral folds and liver edge elevation. Absence of abdominal wall fat stranding or inflammation.</li>
                <li><strong>Bowel:</strong> No obstruction is seen, no evidence of distended bowel loops that may indicate ileus, pseudo-obstruction, or mechanical blockage; appendix appears normal on final coronal and sagittal reformats. Given the possible diverticulitis concern noted earlier in relation to pancreas findings, consider correlating with patient's symptoms (e.g., right lower quadrant pain) if present.</li>
                <li><strong>Mesentery:</strong> No lymphadenopathy within the mesenteric region is observed; this helps to exclude intra-abdominal inflammatory or neoplastic process affecting the mesentery, such as tuberculosis. Continue vigilance for changes in size that may suggest enlargement of retroperitoneal lymph nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Retroperitoneum:</strong> The aorta and inferior vena cava appear unremarkable with no signs of aneurysm or significant vessel wall enhancement. This suggests absence of dissection, large arteriovenous fistula formation (e.g., pancreatic), trauma-related injury to the vessels within this region.</li>
                <li><strong>Pelvis:</strong> The bladder is unremarkable on final reformats in coronal and sagittal planes, with no signs of distension or malignant mass effect. No evidence of urinary stone seen at any level; consider evaluating for stones if clinically indicated based on symptoms/history.</li>
                <li><strong>Bones:</strong> Unremarkable appearance without acute fracture detected, normal joint spaces maintained and alignment observed throughout the skeletal system. Bone marrow enhancement uncommon in plain radiography; additional modalities such as MRI or bone scan may be useful if clinically indicated for suspected pathology (e.g., osteomyelitis).</li>
                <li><strong>Lung bases:</strong> Visualized lung bases are negative with no signs of consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax or nodules observed; lungs appear within normal limits for patient demographic (if applicable) and exclude acute pulmonary pathology on imaging. Heart size appears unremarkable.</li>

            <h3 id="Impression"></h3>
            <p>1. Gallstones are present in the gallbladder, which may require further evaluation for cholecystitis or other complications related to stones within this organ. 2. Fat stranding around pancreas and possible diverticulitis noted; requires clinical correlation with patient's symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain), history of similar illnesses, response to treatment for known conditions such as IBS or inflammatory bowel disease if applicable, which may guide the management plan - monitoring closely and considering gastroenterology consultation.</p>
