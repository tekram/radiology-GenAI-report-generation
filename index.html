    <h1>Model Testing Results</h1>
    
<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:18px;"><b>Problem Statement:</b> Most radiologists leverage standard report templates when interpreting an imaging exam like a CAT scan. However, much time is spent in adjusting the template to actually reflect the findings from the imaging study. The tool here is being designed such that the radiologist would only need to provide relevant findings from the study and then leverage an LLM to intelligently incorporate those findings into a final report, including generating the summary of the report (referred to as Impression).</p>

    
<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:24px;">
  <b>Purpose:</b> This test evaluates the ability of various local LLM models (running via Ollama) to generate a radiology report from a user prompt, using a provided radiology report template as a base. The goal is to determine which models best follow instructions to keep the template unchanged except for lines that must be updated based on the user's findings. Only the relevant lines in the template should be changed, and the rest should remain as in the original template. The summary table below shows the Impression section for each model, allowing for quick comparison of clinical accuracy and template adherence.

    <div style="text-align: left;">   No acute abnormality seen. There is no evidence of diverticulitis in the patient's medical history and all symptoms are normal except for meninges, bowel movements or fractures that may suggest an abnormal presence at one area (gallbladder, spleen/pancreas).
    <br>There also seems to be no fat stranding around pancreas. Possible diverticulitis might occur if the patient is eating excessively and his or her stomach can cause discomfort due to fluid swallowing which could lead into an osteopenic reaction, affecting gallbladder, spleen/pancreas area as well<./br>
